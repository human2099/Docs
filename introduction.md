### Why "Human2099"?

Human2099 represents both anonymity and a futuristic vision. "Human" reflects my preference for staying low-profile on social media, allowing me to focus on my art without personal exposure. "2099" signifies my fascination with science and technology, which is deeply integrated into my creative process. I use large language models (LLMs) for music composition, image generation, and video rendering. AI is a crucial part of my work, and I wanted my name to reflect that. My artistic style, influenced by pixel art and goth aesthetics, is evident in my album artwork and merchandise.
